## About The Project

The EDGAR system of SEC contains all the required **fillings** of the US public traded **firms**, and these **fillings** are an important data source for both finance researchers and investors. However, the functionalities of the system are very basic, thus we want to build a platform to provide more advanced analytic features especially for researcher, using the **EDGAR API** provided by the SEC.



## Advantages

- Investors and researchers can collect financial filings with advanced search criteria (e.g., keywords, sections).
- Provide summary information of target filings by textual analysis.



## Data Source

- EDGAR - financial reports of public traded firms in US
